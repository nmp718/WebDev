    <p>O thou newcomer who seek'st Rome in Rome <br>
        And find'st in Rome no thing thou canst call Roman; <br>
        Arches worn old and palaces made common <br>
        Rome's name alone within these walls keeps home. <br>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The <b>Roman Empire</b> (Latin: Imperium Rōmānum [ɪmˈpɛri.ũː roːˈmaːnũː]; Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων, translit.
        Basileía tôn Rhōmaíōn) was the post-Republican period of ancient Rome. As a polity it included large territorial
        holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia ruled by emperors. From the
        accession of Caesar Augustus to the military anarchy of the 3rd century, it was a principate with Italy as
        metropole of the provinces and the city of Rome as sole capital (27 BC – AD 286). After the military crisis, the
        empire was ruled by multiple emperors who shared rule over the Western Roman Empire and over the Eastern Roman
        Empire. Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until AD 476, when the imperial insignia were sent to
        Constantinople, following the capture of the Western capital Ravenna by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian_kingdoms">barbarians</a> of Odoacer and the
        subsequent deposition of Romulus Augustulus. The adoption of Christianity as the state church of the Roman
        Empire in AD 380 and the fall of the Western Roman Empire to Germanic kings conventionally marks the end of
        Classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages. Because of those events, along with the gradual
        hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire, historians distinguish the medieval Roman Empire that remained in the
        Eastern provinces as the Byzantine Empire.

    <h3>Transition from Republic to Empire</h3>
    <p>
        Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the republic in the 6th century BC, though it did not
        expand outside the Italian peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Then, it was an "empire" (i.e. a great power)
        long before it had an emperor.[7][8][9][10] The Roman Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a
        network of towns left to rule themselves (though with varying degrees of independence from the Roman Senate) and
        provinces administered by military commanders. It was ruled, not by emperors, but by annually elected
        magistrates (Roman Consuls above all) in conjunction with the Senate.[11] For various reasons, the 1st century
        BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors.[8][12][13][14] The
        consuls' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of imperium, which literally means "command" (though
        typically in a military sense). <sup><a href="about.html">[15]</a></sup> Occasionally, successful consuls were given the honorary title imperator
        (commander), and this is the origin of the word emperor (and empire) since this title (among others) was always
        bestowed to the early emperors upon their accession.[16]

    <p>
        Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies and civil wars from the late second century BC
        onward, while greatly extending its power beyond Italy. This was the period of the Crisis of the Roman Republic.
        Towards the end of this era, in 44 BC, Julius Caesar was briefly perpetual dictator before being assassinated.
        The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC by an army led
        by Mark Antony and Caesar's adopted son Octavian. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world between
        themselves did not last and Octavian's forces defeated those of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of
        Actium in 31 BC. In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian princeps ("first citizen") with
        proconsular imperium, thus beginning the Principate (the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated
        from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the name "Augustus" ("the venerated"). Though the old constitutional
        machinery remained in place, Augustus came to predominate it. Although the republic stood in name,
        contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome.[17]
        Since his rule ended a century of civil wars and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity, he was
        so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch de facto if not de jure. During the years of his rule, a
        new constitutional order emerged (in part organically and in part by design), so that, upon his death, this new
        constitutional order operated as before when Tiberius was accepted as the new emperor.
